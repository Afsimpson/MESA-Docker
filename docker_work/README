This is the directory where you should do you MESA work. This
directory gets mounted into the Docker container, so changes made here
persist after the container is closed. Anything saved outside of this
directory is lost when the container is removed.

To get started with MESA, copy the star/work directory here:

cp -r $MESA_DIR/star/work .
cd work
./mk
./rn
