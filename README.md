# DockerMESA

MESA in a Docker Container for easy installation

# Prerequisites

OS X:
Install XQuartz.
In XQuartz Preferences->Security, check the box for "Allow connections from network clients"

Windows:
Install Xming. https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/
Install Git Bash. https://git-for-windows.github.io/
Running docker may require enabling VT-x/AMD-v in BIOS/UEFI, then enabling hyper-v in Windows settings.
(I also had to turn off "fast boot" on my particular ASUS motherboard, but I think this is uncommon.)
