# DockerMESA

MESA in a Docker Container for easy installation

# Prerequisites

OS X: Install XQuartz. In Preferences->Security, check the box for "Allow connections from network clients"

Windows: Install Xming? Install Git Bash.  Running docker may require enabling vtx in BIOS/UEFI, then enabling hyper-v in Windows settings.
(I also had to turn off "fast boot" on my particular ASUS motherboard, though I think this is uncommon.)
